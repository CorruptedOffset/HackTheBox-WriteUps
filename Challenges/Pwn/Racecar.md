  Racecar Writeup
  </h1>
  
  Racecar is a challenge in the Pwn section of Hack The Box platform. The challenge is worht 20 points, so this is a rather easy challenge. However, it isn't called a challenge for no reason. This is a great challenge for newcomers to the world of Binary Exploitation. This was the second challenge I have ever attempted on HTB and the first one in the pwn section. As easy as this challenge was, I definitely learned where my weaknesses are and how to improve upon them.\

  First I downloaded the file and decided to run the program just to get a feel for everything:
